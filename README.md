### Alternatives

If this library's approach doesn't match your preferences, the below is a list of alternative libraries for binding firebase data to MobX observables. They are ordered by how complete, well-designed, and well-maintained I personally view each to be; however, I only took a brief look at most of them, so the ordering (other than the top few) is approximate and pretty subjective.
